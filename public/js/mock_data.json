We found that they don’t predict anything.”",

It’s the ability to pull together disparate bits of information. We assess that using structured behavioral interviews that we validate to make sure they’re predictive.”",

What we care about is, when faced with a problem and you’re a member of a team, do you, at the appropriate time, step in and lead.
